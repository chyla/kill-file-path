;;; Commentary:
;;
;; `kill-file-path.el` is a package for Emacs that provides a collection
;; of interactive commands that can be used to kill (copy)
;; buffer file name or path.

;;; Code:

(defun kill-file-path-basename ()
  "Insert the file name with extension into kill ring."
  (interactive)
  (if (not buffer-file-name)
      (message "No file for buffer.")
    (defvar file-basename)
    (setq file-basename (file-name-nondirectory buffer-file-name))
    (kill-new file-basename)
    (message "Copied: %s" file-basename)))

(defun kill-file-path-basename-without-extension ()
  "Insert the file name without extension into kill ring."
  (interactive)
  (if (not buffer-file-name)
      (message "No file for buffer.")
    (defvar file-basename-no-ext)
    (setq file-basename-no-ext (file-name-base buffer-file-name))
    (kill-new file-basename-no-ext)
    (message "Copied: %s" file-basename-no-ext)))

(defun kill-file-path-dirname ()
  "Insert the file directory path into kill ring."
  (interactive)
  (if (not buffer-file-name)
      (message "No file for buffer.")
    (defvar file-directory-path)
    (setq file-directory-path (file-name-directory buffer-file-name))
    (kill-new file-directory-path)
    (message "Copied: %s" file-directory-path)))

(defun kill-file-path ()
  "Insert the full file path into kill ring."
  (interactive)
  (if (not buffer-file-name)
      (message "No file for buffer.")
    (kill-new buffer-file-name)
    (message "Copied: %s" buffer-file-name)))
